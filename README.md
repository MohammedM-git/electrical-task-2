**My Arduino Servo Controller Project**  

This is a simple Arduino project I built to control servo motors. I used an **Arduino Uno** as the brain of the system, making it easy to rotate servos to specific angles on command.  

### **What It Does**  
- Controls servo motors precisely using PWM signals  
- Can be programmed for different movement patterns (like sweeping or timed positions)  
- Basic but reliable - perfect for small robotics or automation tasks  

### **How It Works**  
1. **Hardware**: Just an Arduino Uno connected to one or more servos  
2. **Software**: Simple Arduino sketch using the Servo library  
3. **Power**: Servos run on external power when needed (to avoid overloading the Arduino)
